# Early Game Guide

# Choosing A Hero
Class summaries can be seen by clicking a hero in the top left once. A text line will pop up telling you what each of the two variants specializes in, click the hero again to select them.

Once you've chosen a character, farm in the starting zone for egg drops. These eggs can be combined with the purple orb (stat item) from the shop.

Holding an egg of the same tier as your stat item will upgrade it. In other words, a +2 stat item requires a +2 egg. If they don't upgrade while holding both, drop the egg and pick it back up.

To upgrade your egg drops, hold two at the same time and type -create

If instead both eggs vanish, the upgrade failed and the materials were destroyed.

Your stat item upgrades to +3 in the starter area.

As for the other shop items, the moon key will be your second item throughout the game, and upgrades the first time using the green stone (also in the store). Every time the moon key is upgraded, it randomly chooses between +str/agi/int/allstats/dmg or hp.

The moon key will continue to upgrade through arena challenges, which we'll deal with later.

For now, once you have your stat item at +3 and you have a moon key with any kind of modifier attached to it, you can move on to the naga bosses. To progress to the next region you need a heart potion drop to survive the waterfall.

Once in the new region, we will farm our stat item up to +3 the same way we did before.

This region and the next two all have the same egg drops, so you can farm in any of them. The higher regions have harder mobs but also higher droprates, and if there are a lot of new players around, regions may become cramped.

Once your stat item is +3 and you have hit level 80, it's time to tier up. Head to the Outlaw Residence cave in the region just to the left of the first town.

![](https://image.ibb.co/k1Ftdz/T1_Potions.png)

This boss in this cave has three drops. There are two potions, a blue one and an orange one. If you click your class in the top left corner you can see the descriptions of the normal type and the mutant type.

![](https://image.ibb.co/bF98BK/Class_Desc.png)

If you want the normal type, drink the blue potion. If you want the mutant variant of your class, drink the orange potion.

The last drop from the tier boss is a weapon that looks like a gemstone. While it isn't required that you farm this drop, it helps a reasonable amount in farming and you will require all 6 weapons to craft a better one later anyways.

After we've tiered and hopefully gotten our weapon, it's time to move on to the first town.

![](https://preview.ibb.co/khjarK/Town_1.png)

Here you can heal at the fountain and spend all your gold on allstat upgrades at the obelisk. Don't upgrade just your mainstat as there are item and region entrance requirements which need allstats.

![](https://image.ibb.co/nOfWWK/Obelisk_Allstats.png)

Buy the "G" and "T" hotkey tomes for allstats. If you earned any early tickets from math quizes or races up until now, you can sell them for some early stats. Past level 200 though I would recommend keeping any tickets you get for later upgrades.

Once that's done, the next region is the Dragon Palace (frost area) attached to the bottom right corner of town. Break the door and go grind mobs until you have a +5 stat item.

![](https://image.ibb.co/c04arK/Frost_Zone_Eggs.png)

If the normal mobs here become too easy, you can grind the rest of your upgrades or finish leveling in the aquarium. It has harder mobs with a higher droprate, and the region is more compact so they are easier to farm (if you're strong enough).

![](https://preview.ibb.co/f9yFfe/Aquarium.png)

After our stat item is finished, we can start collecting the 3 pieces needed for tiering up at level 200.
First we need our mainstat item, each of which drop in a different room.

# Side Note
The bosses and minibosses in dragon palace can drop a yellow medallion item (+8000 hp), so keep an eye out for that. It will be your third item and upgrades more over the course of the game.

![](https://image.ibb.co/dahH5e/Frost_Zone_Hp_Item.png)

Strength characters need the red hood from the untranslated room miniboss.

![](https://preview.ibb.co/kFH0Qe/Frost_Zone_Str_Drop.png)

Intelligence characters need the scroll from the Art Hall.

![](https://image.ibb.co/nwpx5e/Frost_Zone_Int_Drop.png)

Agility characters need the cheese from the Kitchen.

![](https://image.ibb.co/ng04ke/Frost_Zone_Agi_Drop.png)

With our mainstat item in hand, we can move on to the next piece needed to tier. In the bottom left corner of the dragon palace is a statue with a red symbol beside it, stand on the symbol to use the teleport. Warp4 leads to the plant boss room, who drops the second piece we need to tier.

![](https://preview.ibb.co/i1sBWK/Frost_Zone_Statue.png)

This boss has slow moving bombardment attacks that will oneshot you if they hit, so kite around him until you can punch him to death. Or just make suicide runs and put your bag in the room to collect any drops.

![](https://image.ibb.co/kWteJz/T2_Plant_Missiles.png)

![](https://image.ibb.co/ng04ke/Frost-Zone-Agi-Drop.png)

Now it's time for the last piece of our tier up item.

![](https://image.ibb.co/emhTBK/T2_Boss_Room_Key.png)

The miniboss in the Audience Chamber drops keys to go in the boss room, make sure you put it on your hero and not your bag or you will waste the charge.

If the main boss is too difficult, make sure you've spent all your gold on allstat upgrades from the obelisk at town, or party up with someone else. Or failing that, just grind it down with suicide runs. Selling a couple tickets for gold makes a big difference early on if you need the extra help.

![](https://image.ibb.co/b4RYdz/T2_Boss_Drop.png)

As with the previous tier, this boss drops a gemstone weapon. Once again, it's a moderate boost to farming speeds and is an item you will eventually require to later craft with, so I'd recommend staying for it. That being said, you could also come back for it later if grinding the boss is too difficult right now or there are too many other players needing drops there.

When you have the boss drop, use the "hg" command to teleport back to town.

# Important note

Do not use the tier up potion unless your character is level 200. If you do, you will have to refarm the entire thing.
Put all 3 tier items on your hero and walk up to the fountain in town to combine them into a potion. Drink it to tier up.

If you haven't found a yellow hp medallion yet, go farm the bosses in Art Hall until you have one then move on.

![](https://image.ibb.co/dahH5e/Frost_Zone_Hp_Item.png)

The next region in line is the undead area to right of the first town.
Upgrade your stat item to +5 here.

![](https://image.ibb.co/fUL4ke/Undead_Egg.png)

There are also harder mobs in the northern part of the region with higher droprates.

I'm calling this the end of "early game," with the rest continuing on in "Mid Game Guide." This is mostly to cut down on the amount of screenshots that need to load at a time, and to avoid bringing in too many things that might confuse or overwhelm new players.
