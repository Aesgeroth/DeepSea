# Choosing A Hero
Class summaries can be seen by clicking a hero in the top left once. A text line will pop up telling you what each of the two variants specializes in, click the hero again to select them.

Once you've chosen a character, farm in the starting zone for egg drops. These eggs can be combined with the purple orb (stat item) from the shop.

Holding an egg of the same tier as your stat item will upgrade it. In other words, a +2 stat item requires a +2 egg. If they don't upgrade while holding both, drop the egg and pick it back up.

To upgrade your egg drops, hold two at the same time and type -create

If instead both eggs vanish, the upgrade failed and the materials were destroyed.

Your stat item upgrades to +3 in the starter area.

As for the other shop items, the moon key will be your second item throughout the game, and upgrades the first time using the green stone (also in the store). Every time the moon key is upgraded, it randomly chooses between +str/agi/int/allstats/dmg or hp.

The moon key will continue to upgrade through arena challenges, which we'll deal with later.

For now, once you have your stat item at +3 and you have a moon key with any kind of modifier attached to it, you can move on to the naga bosses. To progress to the next region you need a heart potion drop to survive the waterfall.

Once in the new region, we will farm our stat item up to +5 the same way we did before.

This region and the next two all have the same egg drops, so you can farm in any of them. The higher regions have harder mobs but also higher droprates, and if there are a lot of new players around, regions may become cramped.

Once your stat item is +5 and you have hit level 80, it's time to tier up.
