# Beginning from Awakening Tier (Last tier up)

Okay, so we just tiered up for the last time. Now we need to go back to the Labyrinth one more time and finish up our stat item if you didn't find enough eggs while farming your wisp box drop. 

Farm wisp eggs until you have a +5 stat item.

At this point, we have a couple options on where to go. We can either farm base stats from 200-250k at the Sea of Harmony (You can't buy past 200k stats) or we can go to the pirate ship and work on our items some more. 

The Sea of Harmony is above the last town, and has three types of mobs in it.

These mobs on the left edge of the region give you str on kill.

These yellow fish in the middle raise your agility.

And these ones on the right edge will increase your intelligence as you farm them.

They all have the same elite mob spawn that will boost all three of your stats if you kill it. It should also be noted that the stats gained from farming harmony mobs scales with the amount of players in game, so if you plan to be here make sure you fill your empty ame lobby slots up with fakeplayers before you begin.
