# Beginning from Awakening Tier (Last tier up)

Okay, so we just tiered up for the last time. Now we need to go back to the Labyrinth one more time and finish up our stat item if you didn't find enough eggs while farming your wisp box drop. 

Farm wisp eggs until you have a +5 stat item.

At this point, we have a couple options on where to go. We can either farm base stats from 200-250k at the Sea of Harmony (You can't buy past 200k stats) or we can go to the pirate ship and work on our items some more. 

The Sea of Harmony is above the last town, and has three types of mobs in it.

These mobs on the left edge of the region give you str on kill.

These yellow fish in the middle raise your agility.

And these ones on the right edge will increase your intelligence as you farm them.

They all have the same elite mob spawn that will boost all three of your stats if you kill it. It should also be noted that the stats gained from farming harmony mobs scales with the amount of players in game, so if you plan to be here make sure you fill your empty game lobby slots up with fakeplayers before you begin.

If you've finished farming stats or don't feel like it right now, we can move on to pirates next. To enter the region walk into the boat in the bottom right corner of the last town.

Mobs here drop high levels chests and weapon upgrades. These chests have a chance to drop higher quality accessories than just the normal green ones you've found in lower chests. The jump in quality between them is rather substantial, as a green hp regen item gives 25k vs a blues' 70k, and a reds' 200k regen.

There are higher tiers of accessories, but you probably won't see those until you start raiding. For now what we're interested in is getting our weapon to +7 off pirate drops.

As for the pirate boss, he also drops the same weapon upgrades as his crew, but also drops a hp item upgrade which we will want to farm.

After that's finished, we can use the red tomes he dropped to go to the next region. Careful you pick up all your items before you use it, since your hero will be teleported away.

Now that we've used the warp book, we are able to take the portal from "hg" town straight to hell region. It's the 5th option from the top in the portal menu (red text).

The hellhounds here will have two drops to begin with, high level chests and blue eggs. The high level chests drop gold, accessories and red eggs, but until we've finished with our blue eggs we won't be able to use the red ones.
