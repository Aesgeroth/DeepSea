# Beginning from Awakening Tier (Last tier up)

Okay, so we just tiered up for the last time. Now we need to go back to the Labyrinth one more time and finish up our stat item if you didn't find enough eggs while farming your wisp box drop. 

Farm wisp eggs until you have a +5 stat item.

At this point, we have a couple options on where to go. We can either farm base stats from 200-250k at the Sea of Harmony (You can't buy past 200k stats) or we can go to the pirate ship and work on our items some more. 

The Sea of Harmony is above the last town, and has three types of mobs in it.

These mobs on the left edge of the region give you str on kill.

These yellow fish in the middle raise your agility.

And these ones on the right edge will increase your intelligence as you farm them.

They all have the same elite mob spawn that will boost all three of your stats if you kill it. It should also be noted that the stats gained from farming harmony mobs scales with the amount of players in game, so if you plan to be here make sure you fill your empty game lobby slots up with fakeplayers before you begin.

If you've finished farming stats or don't feel like it right now, we can move on to pirates next. To enter the region walk into the boat in the bottom right corner of the last town.

Mobs here drop high levels chests and weapon upgrades. These chests have a chance to drop higher quality accessories than just the normal green ones you've found in lower chests. The jump in quality between them is rather substantial, as a green hp regen item gives 25k vs a blues' 70k, and a reds' 200k regen.

There are higher tiers of accessories, but you probably won't see those until you start raiding. For now what we're interested in is getting our weapon to +7 off pirate drops.

![](https://image.ibb.co/mDFG1K/Pirate_Weapon_Drop.png)

As for the pirate boss, he also drops the same weapon upgrades as his crew, but also drops a hp item upgrade which we will want to farm.

![](https://image.ibb.co/cNnM1K/Pirate_Boss.png)

After that's finished, we can use the red tomes he dropped to go to the next region. Be careful to pick up all your items before you use it, since your hero will be teleported away.

![](https://image.ibb.co/i0auoz/Pirate_Warp_Book.png)

Now that we've used the warp book, we are able to take the portal from "hg" town straight to hell region. It's the 5th option from the top in the portal menu (red text). We can also now use the "hgh" command to teleport to hell (you need to use a pirate book every game to unlock this).

![](https://preview.ibb.co/g4mH8z/Portal_Menu.png)

The hellhounds here will have two drops to begin with, high level chests and blue eggs. The high level chests drop gold, accessories and red eggs, but until we've finished with our blue eggs we won't be able to use the red ones.

![](https://image.ibb.co/iBaSRK/Blue_Egg.png)

![](https://image.ibb.co/gfCJYz/Blue_Egg_Inventory.png)

When we have 5 of these blue eggs, we can put it on our hero to upgrade our +5 wisp stat item into a staff. If it doesn't immediately combine you might need to -create, or drop it and pick it up again. Once you've successfully upgraded your stat item into the staff, the blue eggs will stop dropping.

![](https://image.ibb.co/enY30e/Staff.png)

Now that we have our stat item updated to the region, we can use the red eggs we're finding off pirate/hellhound kills to tier it up. It goes to +20.

![](https://image.ibb.co/fojAfe/Red_Egg.png)

![](https://image.ibb.co/eWXwLe/Red_Egg_Inventory.png)

Since this item upgrades so much, the last 5 upgrades in particular are going to be painful. The general rule of thumb is to try to stockpile as much lumber as you can for the ending here, with it being generally accepted to buy out the last two upgrades entirely. You don't have to, but it will save a lot of farming for that perfect egg to hit 19.

Back at "hg" town, the 2nd last option in the portal will take you to the ticket shop. In here is also the Wood Trader, who offers an item for 200 lumber which will succeed on your staff upgrade 100% of the time.

![](https://image.ibb.co/cTiKMK/Portal_Menu.png)

![](https://image.ibb.co/iV1Ffe/Wood_Trader.png)

The top button here is the one to get a 100% success upgrade, it will spawn in the middle of the shop.

After your stat item has hit +20, it's time to finish up any base stat farming you haven't done yet. Visit the Sea of Harmony above the last town and get all your stats to 250k if they aren't already, it's about as much of a power jump as getting an item upgrade.

Congratulations, you've reached the raiding stage! If you've managed to farm a red accessory drop off hellhounds things will be a bit easier starting out, but with a strong 3 man team having a blue accessory is also fine. If you're still wearing a green tier accessory, maybe consider farming a few chests before you move on to the raids.

# Hell Raids

Each raid requires at least 3 members to begin, and each member must "check in" on the entrance pad for the fight to start.

![](https://preview.ibb.co/ezEb1K/Raid_1_2.png)

![](https://preview.ibb.co/dn5Nae/Raid_2_3.png)

The first 3 raids are found under the hellhounds, and are ordered to follow top downwards. The first raid contains an infernal of random color (three choices). All three have immolate, and will drop a normal and boss chest on death. Each also has a chance to drop a Blue Infernal Stone, as well as a Heart of Infernal in their color.

![](https://image.ibb.co/e5B3Fe/Infernal_Raid1.png)

![](https://image.ibb.co/jzvUbK/Blue_Stone.png)

![](https://image.ibb.co/nkk8gK/Infernal_Drops.png)

The Red Infernal has no special abilities that I know of apart from the generic immolate effect. He is the easiest fight of the three and can drop the Red Infernal Heart as his unique drop.

The Green Infernal has immolate and also calls down small infernals from the sky. A second or two after impact, they deal substantial damage to anyone near the impact, you should be able to run out of the impact zone though before the damage triggers. The Green Infernal Heart is his unique drop.

The Yellow Infernal is the hardest of the three bosses, and has two spells not counting immolate. He throws stormbolts at players for a single target dmg and stun effect, and casts pillar of fire, leaving burning ground which does massive amounts of damage to players standing on it.

Some classes have effects that will change the color of the units they attack, and I personally found it hard to tell sometimes which infernal I was fighting or which drop was what. To that end, it was pointed out to me that the names of both the infernals and their drops are color coded.

Our first craft from raid1 is going to be our class weapon. We need a yellow, green and red infernal heart as drops. These will fuse with our +7 pirate weapon as well as our hp medallion item at the fountain in town. This craft means we are left with four inventory items total, our new class weapon, our stat item, our moon key and an accessory.

The next order of business is to upgrade our class weapon into its full form. For that we need 5 Blue Infernal Stones, also from raid1. Hold the stack of blue stones on your hero and click them to fuse.

Each class has a different special effect on their weapon, I don't know what most of them do. I might see about compiling a list in a raid crafting thread if enough people can tell me about theirs.

![](https://image.ibb.co/jBfEqe/Class_Weapon_Finished.png)

With our class weapon crafted and upgraded, we are now ready to progress to raid2. This is a much simpler raid, and just consists of a single boss with immolate that splits into more units (also with immolate) on death. Those splits also create two more units when they die, but other than that there are no spells or mechanics to be concerned about.

Raid2 has two different drops, including the Burning Rock which looks like a pheonix egg, and the Origin of the Nucleus which looks like a floating crystal.

![](https://image.ibb.co/fmQB3z/Raid2_Drop2.png)

To create your first Ring of the Abyss, you will require an Origin of the Nucleus, and 2 Infernal Hearts (from raid 1) which vary depending on what type of ring you want to make. The various recipes will be listed on a separate thread.

Once you have all the pieces of your ring in hand, head to the Wood Trader in the Ticket Shop. Use the 2nd from the bottom option in the portal menu to get there.

![](https://image.ibb.co/cTiKMK/Portal_Menu.png)

In the Wood Trader's menu, the third button from the top selects the ring related options.

![](https://preview.ibb.co/iZsuqe/Ring_Craft2.png)

Then you want the top option to craft your initial ring for the price of 50 lumber (plus whatever materials you needed).

![](https://preview.ibb.co/gpjUOz/Ring_Craft.png)

Congratulations, we now have a starter Ring to work on and help fill back up our inventory slots.

![](https://image.ibb.co/cBWjOz/Ring.png)

Next we choose what kind of ring we're making, with recipes for str/agi/int/dmg or hp&mana listed on the raid recipes thread.

With our materials gathered for the desired ring, it's time to re-visit the Wood Trader.

Once again we want the third option from the top for his ring related recipes.

![](https://preview.ibb.co/iZsuqe/Ring_Craft2.png)

Next we want the 30 lumber option to specialize our ring.

And that's it, keep upgrading your ring with the recipes on the raid recipes thread in the same manner until it's finished, using the third option in the Wood Trader's Ring menu instead of the 50 or 30 lumber options.

Upgrade your ring to 8%.
