The moon key is an item you have from the very beginning of the game, but often isn't an item that you end up upgrading for long periods of time. Unlike the rest of your gear, it only upgrades through arena challenges. These require both a minimum stat threshold to fight as well as summoning materials which are expended to call a boss.

The first moon key can be bought and upgraded (with the green crystal item) once at any red crystal shop.

The hub world for arena fights can be accessed in the first town through the portal, using the button third from the bottom.

Each portal is labelled with the allstat requirement (Base + Bonus) needed to enter the boss chamber. If you can enter the room, you're probably good to go.

# Note: Arena levels must be completed in order; To upgrade your moon key to level 3, you must first successfully upgrade the key using drops from challenge level 2 etc.

Inside each boss chamber is a red symbol on the floor where you summon the boss. Walk a unit (bag or hero) with the appropriate amount of Ankhs onto the red symbol, where they will be consumed and a boss will be summoned. Once defeated, the boss will drop a number of runes on the floor.

These runes can be consumed by your hero while wearing your moon key to upgrade the item one tier. The upgrade chosen will be picked randomly from +str/agi/int/allstats/dmg or +hp. You can consume another rune of the same tier to try for a different modifier.

The values assigned to your moon key scale with the level of challenge you complete, but each level has its own range which the stat chooses from. For example, a level 2 moon key might get between 5000-10000 str, while a level 3 moon key might get between 8000-13000 str.

# Higher arenas are slightly more complex, in that they have three different types of runes the boss can drop. Arenas 6-9 have these different runes.

Black Rune - Complete random reroll of all lines of stats

Yellow Rune - Random reroll of a single line chosen by the player, for example to reroll "str" into "int"

Blue/Teal Rune - You select 1 line to reroll the number value (for example you have only 11900 strength, but max is 20000 then you can try to reroll this to a higher value while still being of the strength category)

# Note: To upgrade your moon key in stages 6-9, you must first consume a black rune. Having a level 6 moon key but eating a level 7 yellow or teal rune will not upgrade your moon key. After they have been upgraded with a black rune you may attempt to reroll or modify it with any of the 3 rune types.

# Note: Entering arena level 9 seems to require your hero to have at least 30 million hp or damage.
