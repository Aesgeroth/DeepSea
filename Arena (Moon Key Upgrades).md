The moon key is an item you have from the very beginning of the game, but often isn't an item that you end up upgrading for long periods of time. Unlike the rest of your gear, it only upgrades through arena challenges. These require both a minimum stat threshold to fight as well as summoning materials which are expended to call a boss.

The first moon key can be bought and upgraded (with the green crystal item) once at any red crystal shop.

The hub world for arena fights can be accessed in the first town through the portal, using the button third from the bottom.

Each portal is labelled with the allstat requirement (Base + Bonus) needed to enter the boss chamber. If you can enter the room, you're good to go.

# Note: Arena levels must be completed in order; To upgrade your moon key to level 3, you must first successfully upgrade the key using drops from challenge level 2 etc.

Inside each boss chamber is a red symbol on the floor where you summon the boss. Walk a unit with the appropriate amount of Ankhs onto the red symbol, where they will be consumed and a boss will be summoned. Once defeated, the boss will drop a number of runes on the floor.

These runes can be consumed by your hero while wearing your moon key to upgrade the item one tier.
