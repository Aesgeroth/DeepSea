# Beginning from Level 200 Tier Up

The next region in line is the undead area, just to the right of town one. The usual here, farm your stat item to +5. Mobs at the northern end of this region are harder but have higher droprates.

At this point, if you happen to have 3k allstats (Base + Bonus stats) you can aim to tier by killing the voidwalker phase boss. He is located on the west edge of the undead region. He also drops a gemstone weapon, which you will later need.

If you don't have 3k allstats, this is probably the best place for you to farm until you do, as the next regions will be a bit difficult at that strength. If you like though, you can try farming the last bit of stats in the shark cave if the Zone of the Dead is too easy.

After you've tiered, it's time to try out the shark cave in the bottom right corner of the undead region.

This region is considered the fastest way to farm, as mobs are weak, plentiful, and squished into a small space. While the gold value per kill becomes less impactful as you progress, they still drop lots of chests since they die so fast, giving you gold coins and chances at accessory drops.

What we're interested in right now is the hp item upgrade from the starfish phase boss mobs that spawn as you kill things. Just pick it up and it should auto-combine with your medallion, from 8000 to 25000 hp.

Once we have our hp item upgraded, we can either farm sharks a bit for gold (we'll need 10k base stats for next tier up) or we can go work on our stat item again. Back on the main map, the next three regions past undead all have the same egg drops. The further regions have harder mobs but higher droprates, so kill whatever is comfortable.

If you're dying or need to heal a lot, the portal in town 1 has options to warp to other towns as well. The first option goes to town 2, and the second option goes to town 3. You can "hg" and warp back if that's any easier than walking back and forth by the fountains.

Your stat item goes to +8 here.

The zombies beside town 3 have a chance to spawn a phase boss as you kill them, which we will be using for our next tier at 10k stats (Base + Bonus), as well as our next gemstone weapon. Once you've finished your stat item, you can farm any remaining base stats here or back in the shark cave.

After we've tiered up, it's time to move on to the next areas. Once again, the next three mob types all drop the same eggs, with higher mobs having a higher chance to drop. For this set, I'd recommend farming banshees as there are only four voidwalkers past them and they respawn far apart. The banshees are much more numerous and seem to have a pretty reasonable droprate.

Past the voidwalkers is also a region named the Dumping Ground, which is similar to the shark cave but worse. The mobs don't seem to aggro very well and are more spread apart, nor do they have any unique drops that you need to farm. To enter the region you need a key from the banshees, though I recommend just skipping this area entirely.

![](https://image.ibb.co/mmp7rK/Dumping_Ground.png)

This overall region also contains two bosses, the first of which drops an upgrade for your hp item.

![](https://image.ibb.co/iuuJyz/HP_Item_Boss.png)

With that out of the way, we need to farm up to 40k stats (Base + Bonus) for our next weapon and tier up item. I'd still recommend farming in the shark cave, as the speed with which you can farm chests still outweighs the low gold bounty per kill.

As before, be sure to save your old gemstone weapon for later crafting.

With our new weapon and tier out of the way, the next region to farm is to the right of town 4. You can also teleport to town 4 using the portal from "hg" town, it's the third one from the top in the menu.

There are two regions availible, the forgotten ones or the earthworms. The earthworms are harder, but haven't struck me as having that much higher of a droprate compared to the prior region. That being said, the region is fairly small and they give a high gold bounty per kill, so the earthworms also make a good farming spot for players strong enough to do so.

Farm your stat item to +8 in one of these two regions.

![](https://preview.ibb.co/iyX5dz/Earthworms.png)

Killing earthworms also has a chance to unlock the frog region for 10 seconds, which is where you will find your next hp upgrade (from little frog mobs) as well as the 100k tier up and 100k gemstone weapon. Everything in this region is quite strong, so it isn't really worth going to unless you're specifically getting those items.

The entrance to the frog area is the southern edge of the earthworm region (there will be explosions for the 10 seconds the region is unlocked).

![](https://preview.ibb.co/kfOBJz/Frogs.png)

After we hit our 100k tier up and weapon, there isn't much else to do but farm to 150k (Base + Bonus) stats for our weapon upgrade. At this point we can enter the Labyrinth at the right edge of the forgotten ones region. 

![](https://preview.ibb.co/iWYiWK/Labyrinth.png)

There are 9 rooms in the Labyrinth, each of which containing 3 exits. Each door leads to another specific room, but for right now we just want to cross the region, not farm it. You can hug the edges of each room to avoid drawing aggro from the wisps, or go at a nighttime when they are asleep.

To get through the Labyrinth from the start, we're going to take the top left door, then top right, bottom left, top right, and finally bottom left.

Once we're through, head to the altar on the left and put a gemstone weapon in each of the outer circles. You should have 6 gemstone weapons total, and just in case you missed any, here's a list to go back and farm them.

+300 dmg, level 80 tier boss in cave to the left of town 1

+1500 dmg, lvl 200 tier boss at the end of dragon palace (frost zone)

+5000 dmg, Phase 1 wraith boss at the left edge of undead area (just outside town 1)

+25k dmg, Phase 2 lizard boss in zombie region (to the left of town 3)

+150k dmg, Phase 3 ghost boss in banshee region (above town 4)

+500k dmg, Phase 4 frog boss (under earthworm region)

Once that is done, walk into the middle circle with your hero to fuse them all into one. Grab your new weapon (since it probably fell on the floor) and it's back to farming.

The wisps in Labyrinth are pretty beefy, so it's probably best to farm up to 200k before you start taking them on. Additionally, this will also let you test out each of the wisp drops as they fall to see if they're one of your tier items (assuming you don't know which you need).

However, before we go hard into wisp farming we're going to farm the awaken tier boss drop so we have all our pieces as wisp boxes drop. This will let us test which drop we need as they fall, so you can tier up as fast as possible. Farming the wisps after that point is much easier. The awaken tier boss is north of the town just after Labyrinth, and you will probably have to run back to fountain a few times during the fight to heal up.

![](https://image.ibb.co/jMGH8z/Awaken_Tier_Boss.png)

This guy drops a tier item as well as a hp item, but all we're going to dig for right now is the tier item. If you also manage to get the other, great, otherwise we'll come back after tiering and this is considerably easier.

![](https://image.ibb.co/mFhqTz/Awaken_Tier_Item.png)

Once we have the pipe drop, it's time to head back to the Labyrinth and farm wisps until we have the box drop # we need to tier up.

Killing a wisp in one room makes it respawn immediately in a random room inside the Labyrinth. The wisps can also respawn as numbered wisps instead of the basic black ones. These numbered wisps can drop awaken tier pieces, with a different number drop required depending on your class. For example, sharks (and whales) use the #7 wisp box drop. 

![](https://preview.ibb.co/jCr61K/Wisp_Drops.png)

All wisps can drop eggs, which upgrades your stat item to +5. Don't worry too much about your stat item here yet, they will be much easier to farm after we get our final tier. For a list of which classes use which wisp drops, see the Labyrinth thread on the guide main page.

After we have our wisp drop, it's time to tier up for the last time. At 200k you can use the 4th portal button in "hg" town to jump straight to the last town. Then as long as we have the pipe, wisp drop, and fused weapon we should be good to go. Walk into the awakening circle to the right and enjoy your new form. Remember to pick up your weapon from the floor after.

With this, you've graduated from midgame. Welcome to lategame.
