# Beginning from Level 200 Tier Up

The next region in line is the undead area, just to the right of town one. The usual here, farm your stat item to +5. Mobs at the northern end of this region are harder but have higher droprates.

At this point, if you happen to have 3k allstats (Base + Bonus stats) you can aim to tier by killing the voidwalker phase boss. He is located on the west edge of the undead region. He also drops a gemstone weapon, which you will later need.

If you don't have 3k allstats, this is probably the best place for you to farm until you do, as the next regions will be a bit difficult at that strength. If you like though, you can try farming the last bit of stats in the shark cave if the Zone of the Dead is too easy.

After you've tiered, it's time to try out the shark cave in the bottom right corner of the undead region.

This region is considered the fastest way to farm, as mobs are weak, plentiful, and squished into a small space. While the gold value per kill becomes less impactful as you progress, they still drop lots of chests since they die so fast, giving you gold coins and chances at accessory drops.

What we're interested in right now is the hp item upgrade from the starfish phase boss mobs that spawn as you kill things. Just pick it up and it should auto-combine with your medallion, from 8000 to 25000 hp.

Once we have our hp item upgraded, we can either farm sharks a bit for gold (we'll need 10k base stats for next tier up) or we can go work on our stat item again. Back on the main map, the next three regions past undead all have the same egg drops. The further regions have harder mobs but higher droprates, so kill whatever is comfortable.

If you're dying or need to heal a lot, the portal in town 1 has options to warp to other towns as well. The first option goes to town 2, and the second option goes to town 3. You can "hg" and warp back if that's any easier than walking back and forth by the fountains.

Your stat item goes to +8 here.

The zombies beside town 3 have a chance to spawn a phase boss as you kill them, which we will be using for our next tier at 10k stats (Base + Bonus), as well as our next gemstone weapon. Once you've finished your stat item, you can farm any remaining base stats here or back in the shark cave.
