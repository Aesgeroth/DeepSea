# Beginning from Level 200 Tier Up

The next region in line is the undead area, just to the right of town one. The usual here, farm your stat item to +5. Mobs at the northern end of this region are harder but have higher droprates.

At this point, if you happen to have 3k allstats (Base + Bonus stats) you can aim to tier by killing the voidwalker phase boss. He is located on the west edge of the undead region. He also drops a gemstone weapon, which you will later need.
