# Beginning from Level 200 Tier Up

The next region in line is the undead area, just to the right of town one. The usual here, farm your stat item to +5. Mobs at the northern end of this region are harder but have higher droprates.

At this point, if you happen to have 3k allstats (Base + Bonus stats) you can aim to tier by killing the voidwalker phase boss. He is located on the west edge of the undead region. He also drops a gemstone weapon, which you will later need.

If you don't have 3k allstats, this is probably the best place for you to farm until you do, as the next regions will be a bit difficult at that strength. If you like though, you can try farming the last bit of stats in the shark cave if the Zone of the Dead is too easy.

After you've tiered, it's time to try out the shark cave in the bottom right corner of the undead region.

This region is considered the fastest way to farm, as mobs are weak, plentiful, and squished into a small space. While the gold value per kill becomes less impactful as you progress, they still drop lots of chests since they die so fast, giving you gold coins and chances at accessory drops.

What we're interested in right now is the hp item upgrade from the starfish phase boss mobs that spawn as you kill things. Just pick it up and it should auto-combine with your medallion, from 8000 to 25000 hp.

Once we have our hp item upgraded, we can either farm sharks a bit for gold (we'll need 10k base stats for next tier up) or we can go work on our stat item again. Back on the main map, the next three regions past undead all have the same egg drops. The further regions have harder mobs but higher droprates, so kill whatever is comfortable.

If you're dying or need to heal a lot, the portal in town 1 has options to warp to other towns as well. The first option goes to town 2, and the second option goes to town 3. You can "hg" and warp back if that's any easier than walking back and forth by the fountains.

Your stat item goes to +8 here.

The zombies beside town 3 have a chance to spawn a phase boss as you kill them, which we will be using for our next tier at 10k stats (Base + Bonus), as well as our next gemstone weapon. Once you've finished your stat item, you can farm any remaining base stats here or back in the shark cave.

After we've tiered up, it's time to move on to the next areas. Once again, the next three mob types all drop the same eggs, with higher mobs having a higher chance to drop. For this set, I'd recommend farming banshees as there are only four voidwalkers past them and they respawn far apart. The banshees are much more numerous and seem to have a pretty reasonable droprate.

Past the voidwalkers is also a region named the Dumping Ground, which is similar to the shark cave but worse. The mobs don't seem to aggro very well and are more spread apart, nor do they have any unique drops that you need to farm. To enter the region you need a key from the banshees, though I recommend just skipping this area entirely.

This overall region also contains two bosses, the first of which drops an upgrade for your hp item.

With that out of the way, we need to farm up to 40k stats (Base + Bonus) for our next weapon and tier up item. I'd still recommend farming in the shark cave, as the speed with which you can farm chests still outweighs the low gold bounty per kill.

As before, be sure to save your old gemstone weapon for later crafting.

With our new weapon and tier out of the way, the next region to farm is to the right of town 3. You can also teleport to town 3 using the portal from "hg" town, it's the third one from the top in the menu.

There are two regions availible, the forgotten ones or the earthworms. The earthworms are harder, but haven't struck me as having that much higher of a droprate compared to the prior region. That being said, the region is fairly small and they give a high gold bounty per kill, so the earthworms also make a good farming spot for players strong enough to do so.

Killing earthworms also has a chance to unlock the frog region for 10 seconds, which is where you will find your next hp upgrade (from little frog mobs) as well as the 100k tier up and 100k gemstone weapon. Everything in this region is quite strong, so it isn't really worth going to unless you're specifically getting those items.
